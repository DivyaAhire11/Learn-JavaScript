    
     ARRAY METHODS


  1) includes():

   This method checks if an element exits in an array.
   It returns true if the element is found,and false otherwise.
   eg:
       let arr = [10,20,30];
       arr.includes(20); //true

 2) indexOf():

    This method returns the first index of an element.
    If the element is not present, it returns -1.
    eg:
       let color = ["red","yellow","pink","blue"];
       color.indexOf("pink");


  3) reverse():

    This method reverses the order of the elements in an array in place.
     This means it modifies the original array.
  
  4)sort();
  This method sorts the elements of an array in place.
   By default, it sorts elements as strings in alphabetical (ascending) order.
   
  5)slice()
     Copy part of array
     do not change original array

  6)splice()
     add/remove at any position

  **Key Points Must be Imp to Remember**

   .  No need to define size when creating an array
   .  we can add or remove element anytime
   .  first element at zero index
   .  last element at [ arr.length - 1 ]
   .  JS array can store any type of data together eg: number ,strings,function,object,boolean etc
   .  array is a special kind of object
