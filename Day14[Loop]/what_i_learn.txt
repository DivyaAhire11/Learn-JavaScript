   ** Loops **

1] while loop : It is used to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

while (condition) {
     // code block to be executed
}

    Key Points:
       1] Condition Checked First: The loop runs only if the condition is true at the beginning.

       2] Repeats Indefinitely : If the condition never becomes false, it leads to an infinite loop.

       3] Be Sure to Update Loop Variable: Usually, something inside the loop changes the condition.

       4] Can be Used When the Number of Iterations is Unknown
